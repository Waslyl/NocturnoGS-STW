# NocturnoV1 (Legacy)

## PLEASE NOTE: THIS REPOSITORY IS OUTDATED AND THEREFORE IS NO LONGER BEING WORKED ON. THE CODE WILL ALSO BE OUTDATED AS IT IS FROM 2021.

This is the source-code for NocturnoV1 which was released back in 2021. I am officially open-sourcing this for the following reasons:
1. It was already leaked years ago, though the leak is slightly outdated.
2. This repository's state is EXTREMELY outdated compared to Nocturno's current state.
3. This is being opened for Educational purposes only.

You are welcome to use this repository for learning/educational purposes so long as it follows the license provided!

## HOW TO RUN

1. Clone the Repository
2. Open in Visual Studio (2022 recommended)
3. Set the project to Release (if set to Debug)
4. Go to Nocturno's Project properties, set the output location to where you want the DLL to compile to
5. Build the Project Solution. Find the Compiled DLL in the location you set in step 4.
6. Open Fortnite using any private server you have.
7. Once in the STW Frontend, inject the NocturnoV1 DLL.
8. Go to the map and press start!
9. If done correcty, you should be able to load in-game!
