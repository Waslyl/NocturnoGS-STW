# NocturnoV1 (Legacy)

## PLEASE NOTE. THIS REPOSITORY IS OUTDATED AND THEREFORE IS NO LONGER BEING WORKED ON. PLEASE WAIT FOR V2's SOURCE TO GO PUBLIC.

This is the source-code for NocturnoV1 which was released back in 2021. I am officially open-sourcing this for the followign reasons:
1. It was already leaked years ago, though the leak is slightly outdated.
2. This repository's state is EXTREMELY outdated compared to Nocturno's current state.
3. This is being opened for Educational purposes only.

You are welcome to use this repository for learning/educational purposes so long as it follows the license provided!
